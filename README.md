NaNoGenMo 2014

this is my (late) entry to NaNoGenMo.  I scrape a phrase search engine (sorry) and then sort these using levenshtein distance.  parts of it seem really lyrical to me, other parts less so :)  by the end of each number, things get a bit crazy. 

since I'm hitting the server for this data and they might not like that, including the supporting files here for anyone to use.
