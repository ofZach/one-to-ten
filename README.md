NaNoGenMo 2014

this is my (late) entry to NaNoGenMo.  I scrape a phrase search engine (sorry) and then sort these using levenshtein distance.  parts of it seem really lyrical to me, other parts less so :)  by the end of each number, things get a bit crazy. 

since I'm hitting the server for this data and they might not like that, including the supporting files here for anyone to use.  I've also commented out the scraping code. 

some excerpts:
